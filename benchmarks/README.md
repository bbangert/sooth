# benchmarks

This directory contains the benchmarks for the Sooth library. It's primarily
intended to check performance of observe and select with large quantities of
unique events/ids and mixed quantities of each.

If you would like to try a different data structure for the predictor, you can
run the benchmarks here before altering the code to get a local baseline.
